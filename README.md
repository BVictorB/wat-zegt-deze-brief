# Debriefing

## Main Design Challenge

<details>
<summary>Client Description</summary>
Our client for this project is Tessa De Goede, alumnus of Communication & Multimediadesign. For her graduation project Tessa came up with the idea to create a application for functional illiterate minorities.
The current problem for this target audience is that they don't speak and write the dutch language well and have problems with understanding letters they receive from organisations and bodies. Currently these people are dependent on their neighbours, family or community centers to explain the letters to them. The steps a functinal illiterate minority has to take to get the letters explained to them are currently cumbersome and time consuming.

The Wat Zegt Deze Brief application wants to resolve this problem by providing a platform where functional illiterate minorities can submit the letters they receive from organisaties and bodies.
Volunteers will be active on the platform and translate/explain these letters to these people so they know which steps they have to take next. Thus eliminating the time consuming process of finding a person that can help them explain the letter.

The research and design of the application has already been delivered by our client. Our job is to create a web-application for this concept. For this project we will be working with the Scrum methodology, this is an agile development methodology where we, the developers, will working in an iterative process. We will be working in sprints of 1 week to develop the functionalities of the application and present the prototype to our client at the end of the week. This helps us generating value for our client by working in an effective way with clear communication between the client and us (the developers).
