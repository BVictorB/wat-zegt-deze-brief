# Debriefing

## Problem Statement and Design Challenge

Low-literate NT2 people in The Netherlands have a hard time dealing with formal letters they don't but want to understand. It's very difficult for them to assess if the letters require immediate action. They usually have to ask help from community centers, neighbors or family, which may take more time than necessary. Another factor is that more than enough people inside this demographic are ashamed of being low-literate, which makes opening up about it and asking for help difficult.

So the solution to this problem should be fast and anonymous, so that users don't feel uncomfortable asking for help. This is how we formulate the design challenge from the problem statement:

> How can we develop a mobile application where low-literate NT2 citizens get explanations for letters they don't understand?

## Client Description

Our client for this project is Tessa De Goede, alumnus of Communication & Multimediadesign. For her graduation project Tessa came up with the idea to create a application for functional illiterate minorities.
The current problem for this target audience is that they don't speak and write the dutch language well and have problems with understanding letters they receive from organisations and bodies. Currently these people are dependent on their neighbours, family or community centers to explain the letters to them. The steps a functinal illiterate minority has to take to get the letters explained to them are currently cumbersome and time consuming.

The Wat Zegt Deze Brief application wants to resolve this problem by providing a platform where functional illiterate minorities can submit the letters they receive from organisaties and bodies.
Volunteers will be active on the platform and translate/explain these letters to these people so they know which steps they have to take next. Thus eliminating the time consuming process of finding a person that can help them explain the letter.

## Description of assignment

The research and design of the application has already been delivered by our client. Our job is to create a web-application for this concept. For this project we will be working with the Scrum methodology, this is an agile development methodology where we, the developers, will working in an iterative process. We will be working in sprints of 1 week to develop the functionalities of the application and present the prototype to our client at the end of the week. This helps us generating value for our client by working in an effective way with clear communication between the client and us (the developers).

## Stakeholder definitions

### Client

For the client it is important that we develop a working application that has the following core functionalities:

- Users need to be able to chat with each other in voice memos through a chat functionality
- Users need to be able to take pictures and submit them
- Users need to be able to provide a spoken explanation with the use of the dictaphone functionality

For the client it is important that she has a clear idea of our progress during this project. To follow the progress of this project it is important to the client that we submit a prototype at the end of every week and discuss the current progress.

### CMD

This project has been made available to us by the the course Communication & Multimediadesign of the Hogeschool van Amsterdam. For this project we are assigned a coach (Vasilis van Gemert) that will coach us during the process of this project. Every week we will be meeting with our coach to discuss the current progress of the project and receive feedback and guidance. To be graded at the end of the project we will have to provide the following deliverables:

- Design Rationale
- Product Biography
- Individual reflection on the project
- A happy customers

Based on these 4 deliverables we will be graded.

### Target audience

The target audience consists of two groups. The functional illiterate minorities and the volunteers that will help them explaining the letters. It is important to the target audience that an application is provided that fullfills their needs. For the functional illiterate minorities it is important that the application has the following aspects:

- Interface of the application doesn't have to much text
- The application should persist the language level A2
- Text in the application should be provided with an image to make it more clear
- The application should give a spoken explanation of the submitted letters
- The application should take away the shame they experience when they ask for help
- The application should be able to provide explanation in the mother tongue of the user

For the volunteers it is important that the application provides the following aspects:

- Volunteers need to able provide a spoken explanation for the letters
- Volunteers should be ale to read the submitted letters of the users
- Volunteers should be be able to choose for which submitted letters they want to provide an explanation

### Us (the developers)

For us, the developers, it is important that we deliver an working application that fulfills the client's and the users needs. To achieve this it is important that we will be making a schedule that we will follow to provide a prototype every week for the client to see and discuss our current progress.
